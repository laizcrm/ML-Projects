This repository contains generic machine learning scripts created to explore and explain different ML algorithms and methodologies.
The examples are not related to my specific area of work, but were carefully designed to demonstrate how each method works in practice.

Each script focuses on a single technique, providing a detailed step-by-step implementation and comments to help understand the core logic behind the models.
